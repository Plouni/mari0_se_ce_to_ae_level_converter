# mari0_se_ce_to_ae_level_converter
Convert Mari0 SE and CE levels to the format used by Mari0 AE. Works for tiles and most of the entites.

## How to use
You need Python 3 and that's all, no need for other libraries!

The script will look by default for .txt files in a folder "in" located at the same directory as the python script and will output files in a new folder "out". You can change the path inside the Python script directly if you want.
