# mari0_se_ce_to_ae_level_converter
Convert Mari0 SE and CE levels to the format used by Mari0 AE. Works for tiles and most of the entites. The version of SE used was Beta 7, it might work for other versions of SE though...

## How to use
You need Python 3 and that's all, no need for other libraries!

## CE_to_AE_level_converter.py
The script will look by default for .txt files in a folder "in" located at the same directory as the python script and will output files in a new folder "out". You can change the path inside the Python script directly if you want.

## CE_to_AE_anim_converter.py
Place this script inside the folder with the animations you want to convert, it will then modify so that they are fully supported by Mari0 AE.
